# react-redux-todo-list
A simple TODO list build using React and Redux libraries

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

1. The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
2. The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
3. To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.
